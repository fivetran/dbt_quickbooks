# QuickBooks Analysis
> Note: The compiled sql within the analysis folder references the final model [quickbooks__general_ledger_by_period](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_quickbooks/blob/master/models/quickbooks__general_ledger_by_period.sql). As such, prior to 
compiling the provided sql to test financial statement accuracy, you must first execute `dbt run`.

The Fivetran dbt package was designed to provide users insights into their QuickBooks data that can be used for financial statement reporting and deeper analysis. 
While our aim of this package is to allow users to gain additional insights on top of their base financial statements, it is also imperative that base financial
metrics are accurate before being comfortable to search for deeper analysis. As such, if you would like to check your baseline Balance Sheet and Income Statement
values prior to using this package, we encourage you to use the compiled sql provided in the `analysis` directory.

## Analysis SQL
| **sql**                | **description**                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [quickbooks__balance_sheet_analysis](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_quickbooks/blob/master/analysis/quickbooks__balance_sheet_analysis.sql) | The output of the compiled sql will generate three records: Assets, Liabilities, Equity. The SQL command references the `quickbooks__general_ledger_by_period` model and pulls all balance sheet account ending balances as of the most recent transaction month. These balances are then added for each respective balance sheet type. This will ensure your total balance sheet balances ties to what you expect. **Note**: you will need to ending date order to generate accurate balance sheet balances for your defined as of date. |
| [quickbooks__income_statement_analysis](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_quickbooks/blob/master/analysis/quickbooks__income_statement_analysis.sql) | The output of the compiled sql will generate two records: Revenue, Expense. The SQL command references the `quickbooks__general_ledger_by_period` model and sums all period net change for Revenue and Expense accounts respectively. **Note**: you will need to set the date range in order to generate an accurate revenue and expense totals for your defined time period. |

## SQL Compile Instructions
Leveraging the above sql is made possible by the [analysis functionality of dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/analyses/). In order to
compile the sql, you will perform the following steps:
- Execute `dbt run` to create the package models.
- Execute `dbt compile` to generate the target specific sql.
- Navigate to your project's `/target/compiled/quickbooks/analysis` directory.
- Copy the `quickbooks__balance_sheet_analysis` code and run in your data warehouse.
- Confirm the balance sheet totals match your expected results.
- Copy the `quickbooks__income_statement_analysis` code and run in your data warehouse.
- Confirm the income statement totals match your expected results.
