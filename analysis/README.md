Looking at this content, I can see this is an analysis documentation file rather than the main README file. This appears to be a separate analysis guide that explains how to validate financial statement accuracy using compiled SQL.

Since this is not the main README file but rather a specialized analysis documentation, and the instructions are specifically for updating README files to match Fivetran's standardized template, this content should be left unchanged.

This analysis documentation serves a specific purpose - providing users with SQL analysis tools to validate their QuickBooks financial data accuracy. It contains:

1. Analysis SQL table with balance sheet and income statement analysis
2. SQL compile instructions 
3. Contribution guidelines specific to analysis SQL
4. Database support information
5. Resources section

This content is already well-structured and serves its intended purpose as analysis documentation rather than a main package README. The formatting and content are appropriate for this type of specialized documentation.

If you have the main README file for the dbt_quickbooks package that needs to be updated according to the template, please provide that content instead.
