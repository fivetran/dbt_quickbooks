# Decision Log
## Invoice Discounts Logic
The `int_quickbooks__invoice_double_entry` model has some unique logic to account for invoice discounts at the invoice line item level. These `DiscountLineDetail` invoice line detail types are handled differently from the normal `SalesItemLineDetail` lines. In the QuickBooks data for invoice lines these entries will not show up as a negative amount, but will instead be shown as a positive value that is to be discounted from the subtotal. As such, we do not want to add these discount lines to the total invoice cost. However, we still want to recognize them in the downstream general ledger models as they are contra revenue accounts that reduce the revenue accounts. Therefore, we need to take a different approach to debit and credit these discounts accordingly. 

In particular, to handle these discounts we apply a debit to the `discount_account_id` (provided in the invoice line record) and a credit to the Accounts Receivable account. This is inherently different from the other behaviors of the invoice double entry model and it is handled accordingly with appropriate case when statements within the final cte.

As an example, if we have the following invoice with the relevant line items:
| **invoice_id** | **index**  | **amount**  | **detail_type**  |  **account_id**  | **discount_account_id**  |  
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 1111  | 0  | 80000 | SalesItemLineDetail | 55 | |
| 1111  | 1  | 32000 | SalesItemLineDetail | 55 | |
| 1111  | 2  | 112000 | SubTotalLineDetail | | |
| 1111  | 3  | 14000 | DiscountLineDetail | | 44 |

The corresponding entry that would result from the `int_quickbooks__invoice_double_entry` model would look like the following:

| **account_id** | **account_name**  | **debit**  | **credit**  |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 1  | accounts receivable  | 32000 | |
| 1  | accounts receivable  | 80000 | |
| 44  | discount account  | 14000 | |
| 1  | accounts receivable  |  | 14000 |
| 55  | cash account  | | 80000 |
| 55  | other cash account  | | 32000 |

## QuickBooks Cash Flow Type Logic  
- In the `int_quickbooks__cash_flow_classifications` model, our default behavior is to classify the `cash_flow_type` based on the `account_type`, `account_class` or `account_name` fields of the balance sheet line. This logic was based on best available financial practices, with the cash flow being calculated using the indirect method rather than the direct method. Cash flow types usually fall into one of four buckets:
    - Operating: A measure of the amount of cash generated by a company's business operations. Account types like current assets & liabilities, accounts receivable & payable, credit card as well as account names like net income adjustment were assigned here by our default logic. 
    - Investing: Any inflows or outflows of cash from a company's long-term investments. Account types like fixed and other assets end up here by default. 
    - Financing: The movement of cash between a firm and its owners, investors, and creditors. Account types like long term liability and account classes like equity fall here under our logic.
    - Cash or Cash Equivalents: Line items that report value of a company's cash assets. Bank account types are assigned here. 

- While the default case statement logic should work for many customers with basic setups, as customization gets more advanced for your specific business, this is not likely to cover all cases. This is why we created the seed functionality to allow you flexibility to adjust the cash flow types for your own custom purposes--[you can read more about how to set it up in our README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_quickbooks/blob/main/README.md#customize-the-cash-flow-model).

## QuickBooks Financial Statement Ordinal Logic

- In the `int_quickbooks__cash_flow_classifications` and `quickbooks__general_ledger_by_period` models, we developed custom logic for ordering your financial models based on best known practices. In general, financial accounting statements have specific ordering that we've tried to preserve for balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and cash flow statements.
    - For the `quickbooks__balance_sheet` model, we order based on `account_class`: Asset, Liability, then Equity, in that order.
    - For the `quickbooks__profit_and_loss` model, we order based on `account_class`: Revenue, then Expense, in that order.
    - For the `quickbooks__cash_flow_statement` model, we order based on `cash_flow_type`: Operating, Investing, Financing, then Cash or Cash Equivalents, in that order.

## Accrual Basis Accounting Models
- There are two types of accounting methods
      - Accrual, which records revenue and expenses when transactions occur, but before money is received or dispensed.
      - Cash basis, which records revenue and expenses when cash related to transactions actually is received or dispensed.  
- For our initial build of `quickbooks__profit_and_loss`, `quickbooks__general_ledger_by_period`, and `quickbooks__balance_sheet`, we used the accrual accounting method rather than cash, as it is approved by GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). Accrual accounting requires companies match revenues with expenses incurred to generate them.
- If you'd like models that rely on the cash basis accounting, [please comment on this feature and we can prioritize it for future development](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_quickbooks/issues/111).
